## [Heart Disease Anomaly Detection](DetectieAnomalii.ipynb)

Detects anomalies in the Heart Disease dataset using PyOD's KNN, ABOD, IForest, and OCSVM algorithms. The data is preprocessed with StandardScaler and PCA to improve detection. Both local and cluster anomalies are identified, with results evaluated through ROC, precision, Silhouette, and Calinski-Harabasz scores.

## [Hyperspectral Data Classification](ImaginiHiperspectrale.ipynb)

Classifies crop types in the GHISACONUS dataset using SVM and Neural Networks. The spectral data is preprocessed with StandardScaler and PCA to enhance model performance. The trained models label crops, and their results are assessed using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.
